            <p>Dear Sir/Madam,</p>
            <p><b>RE: APPLICATION FOR THE POSITION OF PROGRAMME ASSOCIATE</b></p>
            <p>I am writing to express my interest in the Programme Associate position at Royal Roads University, as advertised. With a passion for higher education and a proven track record in program coordination, I am excited about the opportunity to contribute to the dynamic environment at your esteemed institution.</p>
            <p>I am currently a student at Royal Roads University pursuing Master of Global Management. I am also a graduate in Master of Education (Guidance and counseling) and Bachelor of Education (Arts). I have sixteen years work experience working as a Social Worker. I am eager to embark on a career where I can utilize my skills and enthusiasm to support academic programs and initiatives. Throughout my work experience, I have honed my abilities in project management, communication, and collaboration, which I believe align well with the requirements of the Programme Associate role.</p>
            <p>During my previous role as a Principal Gender Officer at the Ministry of Public Service, Gender, and Affirmative Action, I had the opportunity to coordinate various projects and events, including International Women Days, Widowsâ€™ Days, Youth Days and Kenya Youth Employment and Opportunities Project (KYEOP). These experiences have equipped me with the ability to manage multiple tasks efficiently, pay meticulous attention to detail, and adapt to evolving priorities - qualities that are essential for success in a fast-paced university setting.</p>
            <p>I am particularly drawn to RRU's commitment to fostering innovation and excellence in education, and I am eager to contribute to this mission in the role of Programme Associate. I am impressed by the university's dedication to supporting students' academic and personal growth, and I am excited about the prospect of being part of a team that shares these values.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, my strong interpersonal skills and ability to collaborate effectively with diverse stakeholders will allow me to thrive in a role that involves liaising with faculty, staff, students, and external partners. I am confident that my proactive approach and passion for education will enable me to make meaningful contributions to the success of the programs within the university.</p>
            <p>Thank you for considering my application.</p>
            <p>Attached, please find my resume for your review. I am available at your earliest convenience for an interview and can be reached at 2509866125 or via email at gracendirangu502@gmail.com.</p>
            <p>Kind regards,</p>
